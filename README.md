# 20191014 - 20191015 Software Carpentry: example materials for git

## Overview

This repository holds the example materials I used for live codeing in the Software Carpentry git session on 20191014, U Mich. The example materials were intended to show `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, and `git clone`.

## Content

A cleaned-up version of the slides is provided in the `slides` subdirectory. The cleaned-up version is modified from from the slide deck I used in teaching but with less animation and is more printing-friendly.

[Here is my personal Google Form survey about the content and delivery of the materials.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-k-XDdPAENJmFNCgTLAyhg0Oi_Izg0Q7w2aDFFPrgocRxZA/viewform?usp=sf_link) I would really appreciate if you would like to fill that out.

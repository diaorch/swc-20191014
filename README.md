# 20191014 - 20191015 Software Carpentry: example materials for git

## Overview

This repository holds the example materials I used for live codeing in the Software Carpentry git session on 20191014, U Mich. The example materials were intended to show `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, and `git clone`.

## Content

A cleaned-up version of the slides is provided in the `slides` subdirectory. The cleaned-up version is modified from from the slide deck I used in teaching but with less animation and is more printing-friendly.
